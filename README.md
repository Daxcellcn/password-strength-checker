## Introduction

This is a Python script for checking the strength of passwords. It assesses passwords based on criteria like length, character variety, and common word detection to help users generate secure passwords.

### How I Got the Idea

I developed this project because I recognized the importance of strong passwords in enhancing online security. Weak passwords are a significant vulnerability that can lead to security breaches. By creating this password strength checker, I wanted to provide a simple tool to help users better protect their accounts and data.

- Checks password length (at least 8 characters).
- Ensures character variety, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
- Detects common words and phrases used in weak passwords.
- Provides feedback on password strength.
